1️⃣ Control Flow
Control flow determines how the program executes based on conditions.

Statement	     Meaning                                                     Example
if	          Executes code if condition is True   	                       if age > 18:
elif	      Checks another condition if previous if was False	        elif age == 18:
else	      Runs if all previous conditions are False	                else: print("Not allowed")

✅ Example
age = 20
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")
elif age == 18:
    print("Just turned adult")
else:
    print("Minor")


2️⃣ Loops
Loops repeat a block of code multiple times.

Loop Type	            Meaning	                                       Example
for loop	        Loops over a sequence (list, range, etc.) 	    for i in range(5):
while loop	        Loops while condition is True	                 while x < 10:
break	            Stops the loop immediately                     	if x == 5: break
continue	        Skips current iteration & moves to next	        if x == 2: continue

✅ Example: for Loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4

✅ Example: while Loop
x = 1
while x <= 3:
    print(x)  # Output: 1 2 3
    x += 1
These are essential for decision-making and repetitive tasks in Python!
